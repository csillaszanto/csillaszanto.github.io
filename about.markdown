### Beyond data visualization

This blog is dedicated to look under the hood of innovative technologies to discover, use, study, distill data, present it in different ways and build upon it. Change your perspective you think about, interact with data so you can advance your projects, your career and your life.

I'm combining analytics, mathematics, natural science and data visualization to help data professionals to find the best way to transform and interact with data so they can work on challenging projects, solving real world problems.
